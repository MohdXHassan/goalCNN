# GOALCNN
My journey to my own End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars.(don't know why)
<h2 align = "center" > First week milestones </h2>

```
1.⁠ ⁠Graph polynomials in python with matolotlib.pyplot(DONE)
learnings :-
1. How to plot graph and see results in graph .
2. Flaw of having different scale of different things looks same in two seperate plot but different in 1 plot .

```
2.⁠ ⁠Import in any dataset and do linear regression on it with pandas to make it a dataframe and sklearn
First thing is to know about regression:= what is it. 
regression searches for relation ship between different components such as how a employess salary
depends on the his exp, education , place etc
in regression we take a assumptions about the variable to be independent and look for a variable that de
-pend on that independent variables.
The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses. The independent features are 
called the independent variables, inputs, regressors, or predictors.
```

3.⁠ ⁠Do clustering on the iris dataset with seaborn for graphs
